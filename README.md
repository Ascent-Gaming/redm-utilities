This is a boilerplate for creating resources in TypeScript, for RedM. From its fork, its dependencies have been upgraded and the `fxmanifest.lua` updated to give `rdr3` compatability.

***By using this boilerplate you agree to the following:***
> I acknowledge that this is a prerelease build of RedM, and I am aware my resources *will* become incompatible once RedM ships.

If you wish to take advantage of TypeScript `4.x` features in FiveM, this boilerplate maybe suitable for you. I'm going to assume you know how to make that change yourself. *Hint, it includes the `fxmanifest.lua` file.*

## Usage
1. Clone repository into your `resources/[local]` folder. Or create a **Template** repository using GitHub.
2. `yarn install` the dependencies.
3. Start developing!

### Development
Use `yarn run watch` to watch files during development.

### Production
Build your production ready code with `yarn run build`.

This will build the client and server script with the `--mode production` flag.

### Automatic Builds (Optional)
The `fxmanifest.lua` is not setup to automatically build upon first FXServer start. If you'd like to setup automatic builds you must add the following to your `fxmanifest.lua`.

```lua
dependency 'yarn'
dependency 'webpack'

webpack_config 'webpack.config.js'
```

However, due to the speed performance of the pre-packaged webpack/yarn of cfx-server-data, we suggest you don't do this and build manually as described previously ("Production").
